            <h2><strong>The death penalty has no place in modern day society.</strong><br><br></h2><p>
                Death penalty, or capital punishment, is a problem we need to address in the United States.<strong> More than 70% of the world's countries have abolished capital punishment. </strong>However, the United States is one of the few countries that still practices capital punishment. The death penalty in America is founded on <strong>vengance and spite</strong>, not justice. It has too many problems to continue to be a practice in America.
                <br><br>
                Morally, it is cruel and inhumane. Will we allow ourselves the power to kill a human and deny the right to life?<br><br>
                Economically, it has no public benefit, and studies show that a death penalty costs for taxpayers more than life without parole.<br><br>
                Ethically, our criminal justice system targets vunerable people in society, such as people people with intellectual disabilities, people of low income, and people with mental illness, and puts them on death row rather than providing them with the help they need. There is also strong racial bias present in death penalty cases.<br><br>
                Public support of the death penalty is at an all time low, but we need more advocacy to stop this inhumane practice.</p>

        <h1>History and Racial Bias</h1>
        <div class='flexboxContainer'>
            <p style='background: black; color: #F1EEE9; padding: 15px;'>The modern death penalty is a direct descendant of slavery, lynching, and racial discrimination. The historic role of the death penalty was an instrument of social control. During slavery, it was used to control Black populations and rebellions. Then, public officials promised legal excecutions to discourage lynchings. Now, people of color are predominately likely to be given capital punishment, especially if the victim of the case is white. The Supreme Court considered evidence that showed racial bias in murder cases in Georgia. The Court accepted that the data was accurate but concluded that racial bias in sentencing is "an inevitable part of our criminal justice system" (McCleskey v. Kemp, 1987). The modern death penalty mirrors the racial violence of the past, especially in the South.</p>
